# rocksmith-toolkit-mac
[Rocksmith Toolkit](https://www.rscustom.net) wrapped in wineskin to work on macOS 64-bit (Catalina/Big Sur supported)

### [Download installer](https://mega.nz/file/zCpE2TJY#ad1mebweBDCwhH2ZPFHMB_isIlNDvwNhE_lcl5Iv_UU)

Also added gatekeeper fix since macOS invalidate .net executables signatures, use it for smooth start.

#### "RocksmithTool" is damaged and can't be opened
After install, you should allow such unsigned application to run, immediately after first open and getting above error, you must do the following:
System Preferences => Security & Privacy => Tab "General" => Allow anyway

**Warning!** First run could be really really slow, please be patient.
