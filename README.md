# rocksmith-toolkit-mac
[Rocksmith Toolkit](https://www.rscustom.net) wrapped in wineskin to work on macOS 64-bit (Catalina/Big Sur supported)

[Download installer](https://github.com/helioxigen/rocksmith-toolkit-mac/raw/master/RocksmithTool.dmg)

Also added gatekeeper fix since macOS invalidate .net executables signatures, use it for smooth start.

**Warning! First run could be really really slow, please be patient.
